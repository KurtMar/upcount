# 📣 Version 2

Happy to announce that I'm nearing the long overdue release of Upcount with improved functionality. The new version is a complete rewrite of the application with a focus on performance and stability.

NB! It's not backwards compatible with the current version and will require a new installation. The new version is currently in alpha and not recommended for production use.

## 🚀 [Upcount 2.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/madisvain/upcount/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.1)

Source code can be found on [Tauri](https://github.com/madisvain/upcount/tree/tauri) branch of the repository.

The new version is built with

* [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

I'd be happy to receive feedback on this new version and any feature requests you might have. Please open an issue on Github or email me at [madisvain@gmail.com](mailto:madisvain@gmail.com).

For developers the following commands are needed to add a language.

npm run extract
```
